Here we are finding best path possible for given two restaurants and two consumers out of six possible paths.
For larger input from intituion we think about using djikstra's shortest path algorithm or some kind of backtracking 
but due to the constraint of preparation time and the fact that Ci can't be visited before visitng Ri.
This problem is NP-hard problem so if we increase the input it becomes very complex to find the optimal 
solution and the time complexity can't be shown in terms of a polynomial equation.
